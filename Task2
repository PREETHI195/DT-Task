MMF Logic Analysis
1.	Row 1: High MQL, Low SQL
	MMF Analysis: People are interested (MQL high) but not converting to SQL → trust-building issue.
	Likely failure: Wrong tone / weak credibility.
2.	Row 2: High Lead gen, Low engagement (MQL)
	MMF Analysis: Many leads signed up but few engaged → headline or hook not compelling.
	Likely failure: Weak CTA / attention grabber.
3.	Row 3: High Lead & MQL, Low SQL
	MMF Analysis: Messaging is too complicated → people drop off before SQL → over-engineered messaging.
	Likely failure: Too complex, needs simplification.


Fixing  Prompt for Each Row
Row 1: Fix Trust-Building
Generate a personalized email for D2C leads who showed interest but did not convert to SQL.
A – Attention: Open with a relatable insight about scaling D2C tech efficiently.  
I – Interest: Share a short case study of a similar brand’s success.  
D – Desire: Show measurable benefits they could achieve.  
C – Conviction: Highlight credibility via awards or trusted partnerships. (Authority + Social Proof)  
A – Action: End with a clear, low-friction next step, e.g., scheduling a 20-min strategy call.
Justification: This fixes trust drop at SQL level by anchoring with case studies and authority.

Row 2: Fix Weak CTA / Headline
Rewrite the campaign email for leads with low engagement after initial signup.
A – Attention: Craft a catchy, benefit-driven headline that directly addresses the lead’s pain point.  
I – Interest: Use a short, relatable story or stat about how peers benefited.  
D – Desire: Highlight what they’ll gain by engaging (e.g., free insights or tools).  
C – Conviction: Include Social Proof by showing how many companies attended or benefited.  
A – Action: Clear CTA like “Register now” or “Download your growth toolkit.” (Reciprocity + Scarcity)
Justification: This solves low engagement by making the headline and CTA instantly actionable.

Row 3: Simplify Over-Engineered Messaging
Revise the email for leads overwhelmed by complex messaging.
A – Attention: Start with one clear, relatable problem the lead faces.  
I – Interest: Provide a simple example or tip that addresses that problem.  
D – Desire: Show how our solution makes the process simpler and faster.  
C – Conviction: Share a mini-case study for credibility (Authority).  
A – Action: Single, clear CTA like “Reply to get your simplified growth plan.”
Justification: This reduces cognitive overload, ensuring leads understand the value quickly and convert to SQL.
