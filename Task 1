Part 1: Prompt Engineering for Mass Personalization

Prompt 1 (CTO of D2C Brand)
A – Attention: Start with a relatable tech insight or trend in D2C (e.g., AI personalization, scaling online stores) in a conversational tone.  
I – Interest: Share a short story or example of how a similar brand solved a challenge or improved operations. Use friendly language, not stiff case-study jargon.  
D – Desire: Show how our consulting team can help their tech setup grow smarter and faster, phrasing it as “you could see X improvement in Y months.”  
C – Conviction: Add credibility gently, e.g., “We’ve helped brands like yours achieve…,” invoking Authority and Social Proof principles.  
A – Action: Close with an easy, low-pressure CTA like “Let’s set up a 20-min chat this week to explore ideas” or “Reply if you want a quick blueprint for your brand.”  

Cialdini principles: Authority, Social Proof.  
Negative prompt: Avoid generic phrases, avoid sounding like a cold pitch, avoid heavy statistics.

Prompt 2  ( COO of a pharma SME) 

A – Attention: Open with a relatable operational challenge or insight (e.g., supply chain delays, small wins in efficiency) in a conversational tone.  
I – Interest: Briefly share how similar pharma SMEs solved this problem using smart systems or dashboards. Keep it human, not corporate-heavy.  
D – Desire: Explain how our team can help them save time, reduce errors, or grow faster — phrase as “Imagine if X could happen in Y weeks.”  
C – Conviction: Build credibility subtly, e.g., “We’ve worked with other SMEs who…” using Scarcity (limited slots) and Authority (industry expertise).  
A – Action: End with a gentle CTA like “Reply to explore a personalized growth plan” or “Let’s schedule a quick call to brainstorm solutions.”  

Cialdini principles: Scarcity, Authority.  
Negative prompt: Avoid stiff corporate language, avoid over-promising, avoid generic sales cliches.
